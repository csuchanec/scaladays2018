# Journey to a Real-Time Enterprise

* Kafka sales pitch

* Streaming platform
* Pre-streaming 
  * data warehousing 
    * messaging queues
    *  ETL to storage
    *  ESB's and ESI's (but those are application focused)
  * Point to point connections leading to a lack of ability to scale
* Streaming first
  * More distributed
  * Microservices
  * realtime

* Change how you think about your data
  * Event centric thinking
    * capture and process events rather than treat things as a static pile of data
  * What is an event? - something happened

* Case study Norwegiean - Work and wellfare administration
  * Life is a stream of events
  * Make goverment a stream of events - give services based upon reacting to people's events rather than them needing to search out

* Key characteristics of a streaming platform
  * publish & subscribe
  * store
  * process

* Three lenses of streaming platforms
  * Lens 01 - Messaging done "right"
    * way more than a message queue - how is kafka different
      * Scalability
      * persistance - stroes data (won't run out of queue space)
      * real-time processes
  * Lens 02 - Hadoop made fast
    * KSQL - processing streams of data to create more streams or tables
    * The streaming makes applications running the business different
  * Lens 03 - ETL & Data integration as a platform 
    * Choice between latency & scalability 
    * Kafka connector can be used to replace them
    * stream processing is for more than data pipelines, it can be used as part of the applications
