# Patterns in The Chaos

@helenaedelson


* Learning patterns are something humans are uniquely good at but getting machines to do so is difficult
* Choas - is study of a system that exhibists apparent randomness
  * Choas Theory - understand the underlying patterns in a system

* Self-Organization Theory
  * emergence
  * sychronization
  * amplification

* data lineage - paterns evolved to solve problems

* Fluid roles for robustness - who leads the V in migrating geese

* Swarm Intellegence
  * How does this work in practice
    * Autonomy
    * Decentralization
    * Order - spontaneous self-assembly
    * System-level patterns are unpredictable from behavior of its members
    * Group intelligence and capabilties far exceed the individual
    * No One is in charge
      * no elect, no leader, no single unit in the network knows the whole

* Swarm Algorithms
  * Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)
  * Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
  * Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
  * Stochastic Vehicle routing Problem (VRP)
  * Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
  * Bee nest-site Selction Scheme (BNSS)

* Computational Agent
  * limited cpabilties and intlligence
  * Goverened by a set of simple rules
  * rules provide criteria to make decisions
  * shares information with proximal peers
  * communicats often through brief interactions

* Bee swarms operate like neural nets
